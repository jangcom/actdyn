NAME
    actdyn - A Mo-99/Tc-99m activity dynamics simulator

SYNOPSIS
        perl actdyn.pl [-d] [-nofm] [-verbose] [-nopause]

DESCRIPTION
        Running on interactive mode, actdyn calculates and generates data for
        the activity dynamics of Mo-99/Tc-99m produced via the Mo-100(g,n)Mo-99
        reaction.

OPTIONS
        -d
            Skip the interactive mode and run on the default mode.

        -nofm
            The front matter will not be displayed at the beginning of the program.

        -verbose (short form: -verb)
            Calculation processes will be displayed.

        -nopause
            The shell will not be paused at the end of the program.
            Use it for a batch run.

EXAMPLES
        perl actdyn.pl -d -nopause
        perl actdyn.pl -verbose

REQUIREMENTS
        Perl 5
            Excel::Writer::XLSX
        PHITS
            Please note that since only licensed users are allowed to use PHITS,
            I opted not to upload PHITS-generated photon fluence files
            which are necessary to run actdyn.
            If you already have the license, please obtain T-Track files
            with axis=eng used, and name the tally files in sequential order.
            Corresponding modifications should be made on the directory tree
            via the interactive mode.
